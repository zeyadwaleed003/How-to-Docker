# Docker Commands

Below are the essential Docker commands to build, run, and manage your application.

## 1. Build the Docker Image

Builds the Docker image from Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t (name:version) .
```

## 2. View Docker images

This command lists all Docker images stored on your local machine.

```bash
docker images
```

## 3. Run Docker Container

Runs a container from a built image, mapping port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name (container_name) (image_name)
```

- `-p 3000:3000` Maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

## 4. Run in Detached Mode

Run the container in the background (detached mode).

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name (container_name) (image_name)
```

## 5. View Running Containers

List all running containers to check the status of your app.

```bash
docker ps
```

To include stopped containers, use:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## 6. Stop a Running Container

Stop the container when youâ€™re done.

```bash
docker stop (container_name)
```

## 7. Start a Stopped Container

Restart a previously stopped container.

```bash
docker start (container_name)
```

## 8. Remove a Container

Delete the container when no longer needed.

```bash
docker rm (container_name)
```

## 9. Force Remove a Container

Stop the container if it is running then remove it.

```bash
docker rm (container_name) -f
```
